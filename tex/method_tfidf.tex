\subsection{TF-IDF}

% Ranked user retrieval can be implemented by only using the aforementioned
% \emph{PageRank} algorithm but by doing so, any query would return the same top
% listed users. While that might be interesting in some applications, that is not
% the case in our context. The words in the query should also be used to filter
% and rank the retrieved users.

In order to also consider terms in the search algorithm \emph{TF-IDF} was used, 
which is a well known solution to the problem of matching (in a ranked
way) documents modelled as \emph{bags-of-words}. Each document (including the
input query) is represented by a vector of scores, each of which related to one
of the possible terms in our dataset. The scores are calculated as follows:
${tf}_{w, d} * log_{10}(\frac{N}{{df}_{w}})$ where ${tf}_{w, d}$ is the number
of times term $w$ appears in document $d$, $N$ is the total number of documents
and ${df}_{w}$ is the number of documents term $w$ appears in. Then,
\emph{cosine-similarity} is used to compute how close the query is to each of
the documents.

In our implementation, \emph{User} nodes are documents containing each of the
\emph{Word} nodes they are linked to. This link contains the number of times
this \emph{Word} has been discussed by this \emph{User}, that is, a ${tf}_{w,
d}$ score. The final procedure can be seen in Algorithm \ref{alg:tfidf}.

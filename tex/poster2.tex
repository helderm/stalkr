    \block{The experiments} {
        In both of our experiments, a toy query, "usa election president politics " was
        used. We first tried using only tf-idf and then a combined retrieval with
        standard PageRank, both of which were compared to combined retrieval with our
        novel PageRank variant, which considers how many followers a user has. We graded
        the top ten results of each retrieval as relevant or not and plotted aprecision
        vs recall graph for each of them.  Whether a user is relevant or not was decided
        subjectively by averaging the votes of each member of the group.

        tf-idf results in more irrelevant users (documents) because it only
        considers words, whereas the combination with PageRank also takes into
        account the structure of the data (user authority).

    \block{Conclusion}{
        It is feasible to create a Twitter user recommender engine using tf-idf and
        PageRank. Twitter data is suitable to be represented as a graph. Looking at the
        results, using appropriate parameters for weighing tf-idf and PageRank yields a
        result that is satisfying. Measuring the extent of the satisfaction is
        subjective, but for the group of this project it is deemed that the result is
        satisfactory enough for the given task.

        Due to the limited amount of data and the fact that the data is collected using
        a limited set of correlated hashtags, it is hard to predict if the results are
        applicable to a larger more representative dataset. It would perhaps be better
        to use a larger dataset with tweets from several different topics. However, 
        considering the limited amount of time and resources, the project showed
        that the task is feasible.

        Not only can we consider the links between user nodes, but we can also
        weigh the authority by the number of followers of each user. This yields
        better results as shown above.

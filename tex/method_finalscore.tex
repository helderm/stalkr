\subsection{Final Score}

After retrieving the sets of \emph{PageRank} and \emph{TF-IDF} scores for all users that discuss any query term, we decided to first normalize them to zero-average and unitary variance so that they can be mixed together by means of a parameter $\alpha$. Then, the final score, for each user $u$, is: $s_{u} = \alpha * \bar{s_{p_{u}}} + (1 - \alpha) * \bar{s_{t_{u}}}$.

\subsection{Final Score}

After retrieving the sets of \emph{PageRank} and \emph{TF-IDF} scores 
for all users that discuss any query term, they are normalized to zero-average 
and unitary variance so that they can be mixed together by means of a parameter, $\alpha$. 
Finally both terms are combined, and the resulting score can be seen in Equation \ref{eq:finalscore}, where $s_t$ is the TF-IDF score for user $u$ and query $q$ and $s_p$ the PageRank score of $u$.

\begin{equation}
s(u,q) = \alpha * s_t(u,q) + (1 - \alpha) * s_p(u)
\label{eq:finalscore}
\end{equation}

The objective of this paper is to implement a web application of a Twitter user
recommender system. The application should, given a topic, recommend Twitter
users to follow. The resulting engine uses tf-idf in combination with PageRank
to recommend users. The conclusion is that it is feasible to create a Twitter
user recommender engine using tf-idf and PageRank. Twitter data is suitable to
be represented as a graph. Looking at the results, using appropriate parameters
for weighing tf-idf and PageRank yields a result that is satisfying. Measuring
the extent of the satisfaction is subjective, but for the group of this project
it is deemed that the result is satisfactory enough for the given task.

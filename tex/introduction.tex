\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

With the increase of information available on the internet, information
retrieval is an important topic of today. The popularity of social media, such
as Facebook and Twitter, has contributed to the explosion of data and a demand
for large growing databases. Recommender systems perform retrieval of
information deemed relevant or of interest to a user, using relevance feedback,
user ratings, user history or other information which may help determine the
user’s interests \citep{contBased}\cite{digLib}\cite{userRec}.  These aim to
quickly extract and present relevant data to a user from large data.  Therefore
it is essential for enhancing the user’s experience on social media or on
commercial sites.  

\subsection{Objective and Specifications}

The objective of this paper is to implement a web application of a Twitter user
recommender system. The application should, given a topic, recommend Twitter
users to follow. The specifications are as follows. The topics are represented
as nouns or adjectives, or a combination of both. The web application is only
required to run locally and the data is modelled in a graph database. Users are
ranked using PageRank and tf-idf scores. Lastly, potential synonyms to the words
in the search query are generated and presented to the user as suggestions of
topics to query.

Introduction
With the increase of information available on the internet, information retrieval is an important topic of today. The popularity of social media, such as Facebook and Twitter, has contributed to the explosion of data and a demand for large growing databases. Recommender systems perform retrieval of information deemed relevant or of interest to a user, using relevance feedback, user ratings, user history or other information which may help determine the user’s interests. A few topics of the research on content-based recommender systems are documents [1] [2] and user recommendation [3] systems. These aim to quickly extract and present relevant data to a user from large data. Therefore it is essential for enhancing the user’s experience on social media or on commercial sites.  

\subsection{Objective and Specifications}
The objective of this paper is to implement a web application of a twitter user recommender system. The application should, given a topic, recommend twitter users to follow. The specifications are:
\begin{itemize}
\item The input topic is represented as 1-4 nouns
\item The web application is only required to run locally
\item The data is modelled in a graph database
\item Using word2vec, the input topic will generate synonyms which are presented to the user as a suggestion for the next search
\item The data is ranked using pagerank and tf-idf
\end{itemize}
